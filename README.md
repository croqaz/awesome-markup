There is an increasing trend of new markdown-like super-languages, for various purposes, including: creating websites, presentations, graphs, charts and so on. This list tries to gather as much of them as possible, in one place.

**Please contribute your links**, either by forking and creating a MR, or by [creating an issue](https://github.com/croqaz/awesome-markup/issues) with the link.

When adding new links, there are a few simple rules:

* ideally, the library/application is open-source, so please use the link to the source code (this will make it easy to automate the process of fetching the latest news about the project)
* please keep that link specific to what this list is about: markup languages and make sure the link works
* keep the links in alphabetic order
* have fun!!

## The list

* [ArchieML](http://archieml.org): Makes it easy to write and edit structured text on deadline that could be rendered in web pages. Tag text as data, without having to type a lot of special characters. Similar with YAML.
* [Cog](https://nedbatchelder.com/code/cog): Cog transforms files in a very simple way: it finds chunks of Python code embedded in them, executes the Python code, and inserts its output back into the original file. The file can contain whatever text you like around the Python code.
* [Idyll](https://github.com/idyll-lang/idyll): Tool that makes it easier to author interactive narratives for the web. Create documents that use common narrative techniques such as embedding interactive charts and graphs, responding to scroll events, and explorable explanations.
* [Maid](https://github.com/egoist/maid): Markdown driven task runner.
* [Markvis](https://github.com/geekplux/markvis): Make visualization in markdown (bar, line, pie charts).
* [Mermaid](https://github.com/mermaidjs/mermaid.cli): Markdown-like script language for generating charts (flowchart, sequence diagram, gantt diagram) from text via Javascript.
* [mkcli](https://github.com/mkdoc/mkcli): Markdown command line interface definition. The markdown program definitions can be converted to man pages, help files and shell completion scripts. Encourages a document first approach to writing command line interfaces in a fluid natural language writing style.
* [mmarkdown](https://github.com/albinotonnina/mmarkdown): Interpret mmd fenced code blocks in a markdown file and generate a cooler version of it.
* [Mos](https://github.com/mosjs/mos): Pluggable module that injects content into your markdown files via hidden JavaScript snippets.
