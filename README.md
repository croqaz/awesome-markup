There is an increasing trend of new markdown-line super languages, for various purposes, including: for creating websites, presentations, graphs, charts and so on. This list tries to gather them in one place.

**Please contribute your links**, either by forking and creating a MR, or by creating an issue with the link.

When adding a new links, there are a few simple rules:

* ideally, the library/application is open-source, so please use the link to the source code (this will make it easy to automate the process of fetching the latest news about the project)
* please keep that link specific to what this list is about: markup languages and make sure the link works
* keep the links in alphabetic order
* have fun!!

## The list
