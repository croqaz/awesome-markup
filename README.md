There is an increasing trend of new markdown-like super-languages, for various purposes, including: creating websites, presentations, graphs, charts and so on. This list tries to gather as much of them as possible, in one place.

**Please contribute your links**, either by forking and creating a MR, or by [creating an issue](https://github.com/croqaz/awesome-markup/issues) with the link.

When adding new links, there are a few simple rules:

* ideally, the library/application is open-source, so please use the link to the source code (this will make it easy to automate the process of fetching the latest news about the project)
* please keep that link specific to what this list is about: markup languages and make sure the link works
* keep the links in alphabetic order
* have fun!!

## The list

* [Cog](https://nedbatchelder.com/code/cog): Cog transforms files in a very simple way: it finds chunks of Python code embedded in them, executes the Python code, and inserts its output back into the original file. The file can contain whatever text you like around the Python code.
* [Idyll](https://github.com/idyll-lang/idyll): Tool that makes it easier to author interactive narratives for the web. Create documents that use common narrative techniques such as embedding interactive charts and graphs, responding to scroll events, and explorable explanations.
* [Markvis](https://github.com/geekplux/markvis): Make visualization in markdown (bar, line, pie charts).
* [Mermaid](https://github.com/mermaidjs/mermaid.cli): Markdown-like script language for generating charts (flowchart, sequence diagram, gantt diagram) from text via Javascript.
* [remark](https://github.com/gnab/remark): Simple, in-browser, markdown-driven slideshow tool targeted at people who know their way around HTML and CSS.
