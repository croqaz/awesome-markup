# Awesome-markup ![Awesome list](https://badgen.net/badge/icon/awesome?icon=awesome&color=purple&label)

There is an increasing trend of new markdown-like super-languages, for various purposes, including: creating websites, presentations, graphs, charts and so on. This list tries to gather as much of them as possible, in one place.

**Please contribute your links**, either by forking and creating a MR, or by [creating an issue](https://github.com/croqaz/awesome-markup/issues) with the link.

When adding new links, there are a few simple rules:

* ideally, the library/application is open-source, so please use the link to the source code (this will make it easy to automate the process of fetching the latest news about the project)
* please keep that link specific to what this list is about: markup languages and make sure the link works
* keep the links in alphabetic order
* have fun!!

## Standards

* http://commonmark.org: Plain text format for writing structured documents, based on formatting conventions from email and usenet.

* http://asciidoc.org: AsciiDoc is a text document format for writing notes, documentation, articles, books, ebooks, slideshows, web pages, man pages and blogs. AsciiDoc files can be translated to many formats including HTML, PDF, EPUB, man page.
